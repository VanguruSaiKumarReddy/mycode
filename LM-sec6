6.1 IAM Requirements

Core IAM (already listed in template):

✅ Use least privilege and separation of duties.

✅ Comply with root and privileged access security.

✅ Follow credential lifecycle management.

✅ Use MFA.

✅ Use Conditional Access (Entra ID, mapped to IAM Identity Center + SSO in AWS).

Service-Specific IAM Requirements for AWS License Manager:

Ensure only Delegated Admin account has rights to create/manage licenses and grants.

Member accounts should have read-only access to view entitlements, not create them.

Enforce cross-account sharing only via AWS Organizations, not manual external principals.

6.2 Data Protection

Core Data Protection (template already good):

✅ Encrypt all data-in-transit and at-rest (Marketplace entitlements, license configs stored in AWS backend).

✅ Use CMKs for encryption where applicable.

✅ Use latest TLS version for API calls.

Service-Specific Data Protection Requirements for AWS License Manager:

Ensure license configuration and entitlement metadata are logged only in encrypted AWS Config/CloudTrail.

Marketplace subscription data must remain restricted to Delegated Admin account, not exposed directly to workloads.

6.3 Threat and Vulnerability Management

Core Requirements:

✅ License Manager is a managed service; AWS maintains underlying patching.

✅ Security logs (API calls, license grants, revokes) captured via CloudTrail → SIEM (Splunk/QRadar).

✅ Use WAF for any APIs if integrated into custom portals.

Service-Specific Requirements:

Enable CloudTrail for all accounts to detect unauthorized grant creation.

Run AWS Config + Security Hub rules to ensure grants and licenses align with enterprise security policy.

Use Qualys/Tanium scans to validate endpoint agents launched from Marketplace AMIs (e.g., Zscaler, Qualys).

6.4 Network Security

Core Requirements:

✅ Follow enterprise security architecture.

✅ Use least privilege, avoid * for inbound/outbound.

✅ Restrict public access.

Service-Specific Requirements for License Manager:

Ensure License Manager API access is limited to VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink), no open internet access.

Enforce Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent member accounts from bypassing Private Marketplace.

Ensure all Marketplace AMIs (e.g., Zscaler, Qualys) use controlled VPC ingress/egress with firewall rules.

6.5 Configuration & Change Management

Core Requirements:

✅ Use TDLC framework (plan, design, build, test).

✅ Deploy via Terraform modules (IaC).

✅ Follow tagging standards.

✅ Use approved AMIs/configurations.

Service-Specific Requirements for License Manager:

Manage license grants and subscriptions via Terraform or Service Catalog, not console.

All Marketplace approvals must go through CCoE review + CSAP approval workflow.

Maintain version control for Terraform modules that create/update grants.

6.6 Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

Core Requirements:

✅ CloudTrail logs all License Manager API activity.

✅ Logs aggregated into Cyber Fusion Center (SIEM).

✅ Enable alarms and incident response workflows.

Service-Specific Requirements for License Manager:

Create CloudWatch alarms for unusual activity (e.g., sudden bulk license grants, revokes).

Integrate Config rules to track license configurations and entitlements drift.

Periodically review Marketplace subscriptions usage vs actual deployments to detect unused/rogue licenses.
